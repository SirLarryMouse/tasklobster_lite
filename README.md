# TaskLobster Lite - Refactored

This is a refactored version of the TaskLobster Lite application, which has been modularized for better maintainability and organization.

## Project Structure

The JavaScript code has been refactored into the following structure:

```
js/
├── core/
│   ├── app.js         # Main application initialization
│   └── state.js       # Application state management
├── data/
│   └── importExport.js # Import/export functionality
├── reporting/
│   └── timesheetGenerator.js # Timesheet generation
├── scheduling/
│   └── scheduler.js   # Task scheduling functionality
├── tasks/
│   ├── taskManager.js # Task CRUD operations
│   └── taskUI.js      # Task UI components and interactions
├── timeTracking/
│   └── timeTracker.js # Time tracking functionality
├── utils/
│   └── uiUtils.js     # UI utility functions
└── main.js            # Entry point
```

## Modules Overview

### Core Modules

- **state.js**: Manages the application state and provides a central store for all data.
- **app.js**: Initializes the application, sets up event listeners, and coordinates between modules.

### Feature Modules

- **taskManager.js**: Handles task CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **taskUI.js**: Manages task-related UI components and interactions.
- **timeTracker.js**: Handles time tracking functionality.
- **scheduler.js**: Manages task scheduling and visualization.
- **timesheetGenerator.js**: Generates timesheets and reports.
- **importExport.js**: Handles importing and exporting tasks.

### Utility Modules

- **uiUtils.js**: Provides UI utility functions like tooltips and date formatting.

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility, making the code easier to maintain.
2. **Better Organization**: Code is organized by feature, making it easier to find and modify specific functionality.
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Breaking down the large script.js file into smaller modules reduces complexity.
4. **Enhanced Reusability**: Functions are grouped by purpose, making them more reusable across the application.
5. **Easier Testing**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test in isolation.
6. **Better Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously without conflicts.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser that supports ES modules.
2. The application will load and function exactly as before, but with a more maintainable codebase.

## Browser Compatibility

This refactored version uses ES modules, which are supported in all modern browsers. However, older browsers may not support this feature.
